# Description of the assignment
The assignment was to create a working chat app. There should be password-protected chat-rooms and public chat-rooms, all listed separately. You should be able to create new rooms, and if a room is not used it disappears.  

# Description of the app
You enter your username in the startpage. There's a main Chat. Rooms are listed on the right side. Hovering over a room will show who is currently there. When a new room is created, if a password isn't entered, it becomes a public room, and empty rooms are automatically deleted from the room lists. You can see when others are writing. When you are writing a message if you put a / in front of a word, it turns into a Gif. You can have any number of gifs in a message. There are more than two word you can turn into Gifs.  
  
## Extra Features: 

**View All Users:**  
When you 'mouse over' a room in the public or private room list, you can see all users in that rooms.  

**User is typing:**
You can see when another users is typing before they send a message, a short 2 sec popup will show that another user is typing.  

**Chat GIF API:** 
Adding a '/' at the beginning of message will try to get a GIF related to the following text, like typing /cat or /happy will add a gif to the chat message, multiple GIFs can be added in one message '/cat /happy'.
